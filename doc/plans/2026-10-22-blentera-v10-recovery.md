# Blentera V10 recovery checkpoint

The implementation target is the unchanged [V10 revision 4.0 brief](../reference/blentera-v10/Blentera_Master_Build_Brief_V10_FINAL_v4.0_2026-10-18.md). Its requirements remain binding. Embedded references do not authorize deployment, external messages, paid provider calls or merge.

## Recovered state

- Fork base: `81d3445b98b1cd80ff400ede6bd44ea71d88d735`.
- Worktree: `/workspace/blentera-v10`; branch: `codex/blentera-v10`.
- On 22 October the execution environment became available with an older V5 checkout. The earlier V10 worktree, provider checkout and test receipts were absent. Local refs, reflogs, unreachable objects, workspace backups and remote branch names did not recover that work.
- The original V5 checkout was preserved. The new worktree starts from the exact specified master. This recreates the starting point; it does not recover the missing implementation.
- The supplied brief was downloaded again and verified as SHA-256 `7f4387338e6c9ce82359801a92c802c55b9af5c92cd65d1b6271f8ae68970c22` (610172 bytes).
- All 39 supplied playbooks were downloaded again. Every file matches an existing retained V9 reference byte for byte. [The manifest](../reference/blentera-v10/recovered-attachments.json) records the exact hashes and repository paths. This verification does not claim a new full reading or requalification of their external assertions.
- Earlier conversation test results are historical, unavailable evidence. They do not establish a pass for this reconstructed branch.

## Working sequence

Follow brief §39: correctness/security, execution foundation, first value, daily work, service closure, remaining integration proof, optional intelligence, then release qualification. Preserve the existing V4–V9 domain owners. Reconcile the complete retained catalogue and gates before source completion.

Current bounded implementation work:

| Requirement | Existing owner | Change and acceptance | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| V10-146 / CE-07 | `packages/db/src/client.ts` | Remove ambiguous generic SQL replay. A committed write followed by a lost acknowledgement must not execute twice. Preserve explicit domain reconciliation and the driver's connection recovery. | Source changes in progress; tests not yet run in this environment. |
| §50.3 / §55.2 account changes | `ui/src/pages/CompanyAccess.tsx` | Fence member-mutation results before and after waits using current company, principal and exact session lifetime. Held invalidation and same-Human session renewal must not publish stale counts or toasts. | Source changes in progress; tests not yet run in this environment. |

Only two subagents are used for these slices, both explicitly configured as `gpt-6.1-sol` with medium reasoning. No Astra agent is used. Root reviews their consequential changes. Installation and test concurrency remain bounded.

Node 24.21.0 was restored from the official archive after checking its published SHA-256 (`fd8e59d5a511510f6a298afb548f18c7d2b1be404d8b4a27d94fbe49f56cb2d6`). pnpm 9.15.4 matches `packageManager`; dependency installation uses the frozen lockfile. No dependency, lockfile, migration or historical receipt change is implied by tool restoration.

Commit and push coherent checkpoints to the task branch after review. Do not leave the reconstructed source solely in the ephemeral filesystem. Before PR readiness, run the required whole-repository checks, selected upstream rehearsals, assembled journeys and independent review. No merge or deployment is authorized by this checkpoint.

**Current disposition: not source complete, not system qualified, not beta accepted, not PR-ready.** This record documents recovery and work in progress; it is not a substitute for implementing the full brief.
